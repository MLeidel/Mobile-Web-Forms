# Mobile-Web-Forms
css for basic mobile friendly web layout and form designs
---
This demo consists of a 'home' page and pages to demo form controls in 'dark', 'light', and custom styles.
The demo uses only html and css files.
The `layout.css` file consists of a mobile menu system and a dynamic two column page design.
The other css files use global variables for ease of alteration. For instance, formslight.css was used to 
create custom.css and custom.php has only minor textual changes.
